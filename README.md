# erc20_leo
Smart contracts that want to use ERC20 tokens have to follow the appropriate ERC standards.
This technical standard dictates a number of rules and actions that an Ethereum token or smart contract must follow and steps to be able to implement it.
In a first stage, the goal is to implement the 6 mandatory rules in Leo Programming Language so that they can be invoked in a Smart contract.
They are: TotalSupply, Approve, BalanceOf, TransferFrom, Transfer, Allowance.
A .leo program contains the functions mentioned above and an input file simulates the test values.
